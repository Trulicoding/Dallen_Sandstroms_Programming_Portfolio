This Linux shell script can take select important directories,
combine them into a backup .zip file, replacing the old backup.
It then takes a specified directory (recomended one that contains the backup .zip)
and Syncs it with a chosen folder in google drive.

It can be run autonomously as a chron job,
uses with very limited google drive storage,
allows for a 'secured' directory where backups happen in a subdirectory,
handles most situations where a backup is required.
